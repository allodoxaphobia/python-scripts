About:
	snarpy is a command line ARP packet generator. Basically it allows you to send arp requests and responses, choosing to either set
	arp fields or leaving them as is. This makes this tool usefull for a number of tests, including:
		 arpspoofing , 
		 arpflooding (either via responses or requests)
Usage:
	type ./snarpy  -h for a set of options. 
	There are only 2 mandatory options, -i and -t
	-i is the interface to use (eth0, wlan1, etc..)
	-t is the target, for a ARP Request the target should be set to an IP address (the ip for which you want to obtain the MAC address)
		For arp responses, the target should be a mac address, without further settings this would claim your IP to be at the specified MAC.

Examples:
	arp flooding:
	=============
		./snarpy -i eth0 -t 192.168.0.8
		#above will send broadcasts requesting the location of ip 192.168.0.8
		#to obtain an arp flood from this, we can set the source mac to random generate
		./snarpy -i eth0 -t 192.168.0.8 -smac=0 --number=1000
	arp sppofing:
	==============
		./snarpy -i wlan0 -f=response -t 00:88:69:66:66:99 --sip=192.168.0.1 --interval=1000 --number=1000
